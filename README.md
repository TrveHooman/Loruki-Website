#Loruki-Website
This is a sample website I made along a tutorial video I've been watching on "Traversy Media" YouTube channel.
However I made this website using a CSS preprocessor (SASS) rather than raw CSS(Which was used in the tutorial video)
Here's a link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4
